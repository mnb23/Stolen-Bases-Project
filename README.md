# Stolen-Bases-Project

# The question I wanted to answer in this project is, **Do stolen bases create a tangible effect on the way a pitcher pitches?** So far, I have extracted and cleaned up data from Statcast (PITCHf/x data) and Retrosheet (pitch-by-pitch data from games) using R, created tables of pitches thrown right after a stolen base (sorted on pitchers) using SQL, and created a map of the pitches thrown right after a stolen base using Python.
